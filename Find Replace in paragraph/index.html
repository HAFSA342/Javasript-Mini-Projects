    <p class="target">Life is worth living with a little balance. Discipline is what keeps a person in control and helps him achieve
        great success. Abiding by certain rules and regulations, man carves his place in society. Parents and Teachers
        are the primary sources of learning discipline for children. To be able to work together with faculty and other
        students in school, one needs control. Anywhere you go, people will judge you on your demeanour. Anything that
        you do becomes more fun with rules. You wont enjoy playing Basketball if you dont follow all the rules.
        Similarly, to achieve something worthwhile in life, you will always have to pair hard work with discipline. A
        well-mannered, punctual person is valued more than someone who does not know how to behave.</p>
